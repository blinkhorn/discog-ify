# Discog-ify

## Description
Dicog-ify allows users to select a record label and generate a Spotify playlist of its available discography once logged in to your Spotify account. The application is in a testing stage at this time â€” I'm still adding features and functionality.

## Example
To generate a playlist of Better Listen Records' discography, connect your Spotify account from the home page, and then search for and submit Better Listen Records on the next page. Enjoy the playlist that will be automatically added to your Spotify playlists.
